# BlueOak Front End

BlueOak FE integrates AngularJS 1.x, Foundation for Sites, Cordova, Gulp, Browsersync, and Swagger/OpenAPI, with a comprehensive build system to reduce the amount of time spent on the table stakes of app development.  Mobile specific widgets that correspond to the BlueOak DX provide a common design language for greater efficiencies in UI development. Additional components provide higher level UI tasks, such as Google maps and card.io credit card number recognition.
